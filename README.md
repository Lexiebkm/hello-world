# hello-world
I am beginner in GitHub, as implied with this repository name. Yeah, it's the 1st one of mine.
It's about time for doing collaboration, because future projects need it.
As for projects, it seems that they will be developed using Laravel framework on server-side code and React.js or Vue.js on clien-side code. More specifically, for displaying data on datagrid for entry, I am still considering several javascript libaries available out there. I have tried some, but haven't made decision yet on which one I will use.
